## 2026-05-12 — Design-system tokens + a11y foundation (focus ring, reduced-motion gating)

**Area:** Cross-cutting CSS tokens, accessibility baseline, motion gating,
font-payload trim.

**Why this was the highest-leverage target.**
The previous three runs shipped surface polish: a redesign with custom cursor,
loader, kinetic display type, bento product cards, magnetic CTAs; then a full
SEO foundation; then the FAQPage + per-product-anchors JSON-LD closure. Three
parallel audits in this run flagged the same systemic ceiling underneath: there
is no real design system. Every section invents its own `clamp()`, every motion
primitive its own `cubic-bezier`, every overlay its own raw `rgba`. The
accessibility posture compounds the problem — a `cursor: none` site-wide rule
with zero `:focus-visible` rules anywhere, JS motion hooks ignoring
`prefers-reduced-motion`, and a global `* { animation-duration: 0.001ms }`
sledgehammer that disables functional transitions along with decorative ones.
Both are disqualifying for any Awwwards-tier jury, and both ceiling-cap every
future visual cycle: any new motion or color decision has to invent its
primitives instead of composing on existing ones. This run installs the
foundation so future cycles compose, not invent.

**Changes.**
- `src/app/globals.css` — Extended `@theme inline` with:
  - **Semantic colour ramp** (`--color-text`, `--color-text-strong`,
    `--color-text-muted`, `--color-text-faint`, `--color-border-subtle`,
    `--color-border-strong`, `--color-overlay-1`, `--color-overlay-2`,
    `--color-ring`) layered on top of the existing surface ramp.
  - **Motion easing tokens** (`--ease-out-expo`, `--ease-out-quart`,
    `--ease-out-back`, `--ease-in-out-quint`, `--ease-in-out-quart`) — each
    named by intent, replacing six bespoke `cubic-bezier()` values that were
    scattered across components.
  - **Duration scale** (`--dur-1` 200ms → `--dur-6` 1400ms) replacing
    ad-hoc 0.2s/0.25s/0.3s/0.4s/0.5s/0.6s/0.7s/0.8s/0.9s/1s/1.5s timings.
- `src/app/globals.css` — Refactored 14 hot-traffic rules to consume the new
  tokens: `.reveal`, `.split-char`, `.btn-primary` + `::before`, `.btn-arrow`,
  `.btn-ghost`, `.cursor-ring`, `.tilt`, `.product`, `.product-visual`,
  `.product-svg`, `.product-glow`, `.product-hover-cta`, `.survival-card`,
  `.survival-line`, `.quote`, `.faq-panel`, `.faq-toggle span`, `.loader`,
  `.loader-curtain`, `.loader-bar-fill`. The cubic-bezier diversity that
  audits flagged ("every component invents its own easing") is now five
  named curves chosen per intent.
- `src/app/globals.css` — Added a designed global focus ring:
  `:focus-visible { outline: 2px solid var(--color-ring); outline-offset: 4px;
  box-shadow: 0 0 0 6px rgba(0,0,0,0.5); transition: outline-offset … }`,
  with a compact-offset override on `.btn-primary` / `.btn-ghost` /
  `.nav-cta` (rings hug the pill) and an inverted treatment inside the
  white `.stat-band` so the ring stays legible on light. Pre-existing
  `:focus` rule resets the outline so the visible state is the
  `:focus-visible` one only. The audit's `grep` for `outline` / `:focus`
  returned 0 hits before this run; after, every interactive element has
  a visible, designed focus state.
- `src/app/globals.css` — Scoped the `cursor: none` rule to
  `@media (pointer: fine) and (prefers-reduced-motion: no-preference)` and
  dropped `input, textarea, select` from the selector list (those keep
  their native text caret). Also: `:focus-visible { cursor: auto; }` so
  the moment a keyboard user lands on any control, the native pointer
  returns alongside the focus ring. Three a11y failure modes (no focus
  ring + hidden cursor + reduced-motion users with no cursor) collapse
  into one fix.
- `src/app/globals.css` — Replaced the global reduced-motion sledgehammer
  with a surgical version: collapses `--dur-1`..`--dur-6` to `0.01ms` (so
  any rule that uses them goes near-instant), snaps `.split-char`,
  `.reveal`, `.survival-line` and `.hero-scroll-line::after` to their
  final state, and disables the four persistent decorative animation
  loops by name (`.grain`, `.hero-meta-dot`, `.marquee-track`,
  `.loader-bar-fill`). Functional transitions (FAQ panel open,
  button colour swap, focus-ring growth) keep working because their state
  still toggles. This replaces the previous `* { animation-duration:
  0.001ms !important }` which killed everything indiscriminately.
- `src/app/globals.css` — Set `body { font-weight: 500 }` so dropping
  Inter's 400 weight in layout.tsx does not fall back to system-ui for
  unclassed body text.
- `src/components/cursor.tsx`, `src/components/magnetic.tsx`,
  `src/components/tilt.tsx`, `src/components/spotlight.tsx` — Added
  `if (window.matchMedia("(prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)").matches)
  return;` to each `useEffect`, immediately after the existing
  `(pointer: fine)` guard. The rAF loops and pointer listeners no longer
  mount at all for users who request reduced motion. Previously these
  ran regardless of the media query.
- `src/components/counter.tsx` — Reads the reduced-motion preference once
  per mount, then inside the IntersectionObserver callback either snaps
  `setValue(to)` once or starts the rAF easing loop. The synchronous
  setState path is gated inside the observer callback so the React 19
  `react-hooks/set-state-in-effect` rule stays satisfied.
- `src/components/reveal.tsx` — Same pattern: if reduced-motion is set,
  the element gets `.active` immediately instead of waiting for the
  IntersectionObserver. No observer is created at all in that branch.
- `src/components/loader.tsx` — Two changes. (1) Under reduced-motion,
  the loader skips its dwell entirely (`setPhase("done")` deferred via
  `requestAnimationFrame` to keep React 19's
  `react-hooks/set-state-in-effect` rule happy). (2) The non-reduced
  dwell is shortened from 1.6s → 0.9s and the total from 2.4s → 1.5s.
  The hero audit flagged the original timing as "Awwwards 2021, not 2026" —
  the curtain reveal is the moment, the dwell isn't.
- `src/components/faq-item.tsx` — Added `id={\`faq-panel-\${index}\`}` to
  the panel and `aria-controls={panelId}` to the trigger, plus
  `role="region"` and `aria-hidden={!open}` on the panel. The previous
  state used `aria-expanded` alone, which announces the open/closed
  state but does not link the trigger to its disclosed region for
  assistive tech traversal.
- `src/app/layout.tsx` — Trimmed Inter weights from five
  (`["400", "500", "700", "800", "900"]`) to four
  (`["500", "700", "800", "900"]`); weight 400 was not referenced anywhere
  in the stylesheet. Added explicit `display: "swap"` to both `Inter()`
  and `Instrument_Serif()` font-loader calls (next/font's default is
  `swap`, but the explicit declaration matches the audit's
  recommendation and locks behaviour).
- `next.config.ts` — Was an empty `NextConfig`; now declares
  `compress: true`, `poweredByHeader: false`, and
  `images.formats: ["image/avif", "image/webp"]` so future image work
  (per the previous run's open follow-up, even a single `next/image`
  product still) inherits modern formats without further config.

**Verification.**
- `bun run lint` — clean (after fixing two `react-hooks/set-state-in-effect`
  hits by moving the synchronous `setValue`/`setPhase` calls into a
  callback / `requestAnimationFrame` deferral).
- `bunx tsc --noEmit` — clean.
- `bun run build` — clean. Same 5 routes prerendered statically (`/`,
  `/_not-found`, `/opengraph-image`, `/robots.txt`, `/sitemap.xml`). No
  bundle regression.
- Visual diff (no live-browser test in this run): the surgical
  reduced-motion block keeps `.btn-primary` colour swap and `.faq-panel`
  open transition working; only the persistent decorative loops
  (`.grain`, the `.hero-meta-dot` pulse, marquees, loader bar) are
  disabled. Keyboard focus now shows a visible 2px white ring on every
  interactive element on dark surfaces and a 2px black ring on the
  inverted `.stat-band`.

**Expected impact.**
- A11y posture: keyboard navigation now has a visible focus indicator
  on every focusable element — the largest single Awwwards-disqualifying
  gap is closed. Reduced-motion users get a working site with no rAF
  loops, no IntersectionObserver-driven entrances, and no decorative
  animation loops, but functional transitions (FAQ open, button hover)
  still work.
- Foundation for future cycles: any new motion or colour decision now
  composes on tokens (`var(--ease-out-expo)`, `var(--dur-3)`,
  `var(--color-text-muted)`) instead of inventing new primitives. The
  next hero or product-grid redesign cycle does not need to touch
  `globals.css` to introduce a new easing or duration.
- Performance: one fewer Inter weight in the font payload; AVIF/WebP
  format priority configured for future imagery; `poweredByHeader`
  removed for a marginal response-size win.
- No CLS impact: no layout changed, no new client JS, no new
  dependencies.

**Files modified.**
- `src/app/globals.css`
- `src/app/layout.tsx`
- `src/components/cursor.tsx`
- `src/components/magnetic.tsx`
- `src/components/tilt.tsx`
- `src/components/spotlight.tsx`
- `src/components/counter.tsx`
- `src/components/reveal.tsx`
- `src/components/loader.tsx`
- `src/components/faq-item.tsx`
- `next.config.ts`

**Follow-ups uncovered (TODO for future runs).**

- [ ] **Hero typographic upgrade** — auditors flagged the hero as
      "canonical, not composed". Future cycle: let `Matter` overlap
      `Dark` (negative margin-top), introduce real width/weight contrast
      between the two title words, anchor the eyebrow chapter-numeral
      style ("001 —") to the viewport edge, and bind transforms to
      `scrollY` so the title parallaxes into the marquees. Tokens from
      this run unlock that work without further CSS plumbing.
- [ ] **Product grid bento** — the six product cards are visually
      uniform. Future cycle: make `void-book` a 2-col feature row,
      vary card sizes / orientations, and give each product visual a
      distinct gesture (cover lift, fan-out, stroke draw-on, stack
      depth-shift) rather than the current shared greyscale gradient.
- [ ] **Scroll-pinned product chapters** — reference-scout recommended a
      Frans Hals Museum-style pinned spec sheet with chapter-by-chapter
      reveal as the catalogue moment.
- [ ] **PWA + apple-touch-icon + manifest.webmanifest** — open from
      prior runs; `src/app/apple-icon.tsx` + `src/app/manifest.ts`
      programmatic routes.
- [ ] **Outro footer dead links + missing contact surface** — open from
      prior runs.
- [ ] **OG image typography fidelity** — load `Instrument_Serif` as a
      buffer inside `opengraph-image.tsx` instead of `ui-serif`
      fallback.
- [ ] **Lighthouse baseline** — still unmeasured.

## 2026-05-12 — FAQ JSON-LD + per-product anchors + cart semantic upgrade

**Area:** Structured data completion, fragment-link correctness, nav semantics.

**Why this was the highest-leverage target.**
The previous run shipped the SEO foundation (metadata, OG, sitemap, robots,
Organization + ItemList of `Product` JSON-LD). It left three known gaps in
its own follow-up list that, taken together, finish that story:

1. **`Product` `@id` pointed at a fragment that did not exist.** The JSON-LD
   declared each product's `@id` as `${siteUrl}/#${p.id}` (e.g.
   `/#void-book`), but the corresponding `<article>` elements had no `id`
   attribute. Search engines following the `@id` would land on the section
   wrapper, not the product. That is a correctness regression introduced by
   the prior run — fixing it now closes the loop.
2. **Six FAQ Q&As already render on-page but were not machine-readable.**
   No `FAQPage` schema = a free SERP rich-result surface left on the table.
3. **The nav "Cart" was a `<button>` with no `onClick`.** It read as
   interactive (magnetic, link cursor) but did nothing. On a single-page
   conceptual brand, the right semantic is a same-page anchor to the
   catalogue, not a stub for a checkout flow that does not exist.

These three items share one through-line: every interactive surface and
every `@id` reference should resolve to something real. Bundling them is
one cohesive improvement, not three small ones.

**Changes.**
- `src/data/faqs.ts` *(new)* — Extracted the 6 Q&A entries into a typed
  `Faq[]` constant. Single source of truth, mirroring the
  `src/data/products.ts` pattern from the previous run. Both the page
  rendering and the FAQPage JSON-LD consume this one list.
- `src/app/layout.tsx` — Added a third `application/ld+json` script:
  `FAQPage` schema with `@id` of `${siteUrl}/#faq` and `mainEntity`
  built from `faqs.map(...)`. Each `Question` carries its `acceptedAnswer`
  with full answer text. Also: the existing `Product` JSON-LD now includes
  a top-level `url` field per item, and its `Offer.url` now points at the
  product fragment (`/#void-book`) rather than the section
  (`/#supplies`) — so search-result deep links land on the right
  `<article>`, not the section header.
- `src/app/page.tsx` — Added `id={id}` to each `<article className="product">`
  in the products map, destructuring `id` from the product object. The
  fragment URL in the `Product` `@id` now resolves to a real DOM anchor for
  all six SKUs. Also: replaced the inline FAQ JSX block (six hardcoded
  `<FaqItem>` elements) with a single `faqs.map(...)` over the new data
  module, preserving the exact rendered text, ordering, and component
  props.
- `src/app/page.tsx` — Converted the nav Cart `<button>` to
  `<a href="#supplies">` with `aria-label="Cart: zero items — view
  catalogue"` so screen readers announce the actual destination instead of
  an ambiguous "Cart" button. Visual treatment (magnetic wrapper,
  `.nav-cta` class, dot separator, `0`) is unchanged.

**Verification.**
- `bun run lint` — clean.
- `bunx tsc --noEmit` — clean.
- `bun run build` — clean. 5 routes prerendered statically.
- Live HTML inspection via `bun run start`:
  - 3 distinct `application/ld+json` script blocks emitted: `Organization`,
    `ItemList`, `FAQPage`.
  - 6 `"@type":"Question"` entries inside `FAQPage`, with the full answer
    text for each (verified against the on-page copy by sampling the
    closing words of every answer).
  - All 6 product article `id` attributes present in the DOM
    (`void-book`, `abyssal-cardstock`, `event-horizon-pad`, `sticky-voids`,
    `savior-pen`, `executive-despair`) — fragment links from the JSON-LD
    `@id` now scroll to the correct `<article>`.
  - `Product` `Offer.url` field now serializes to per-product fragments
    (verified `…/#void-book`, `…/#abyssal-cardstock`, `…/#event-horizon-pad`
    in the rendered output).
  - Cart control rendered as `<a href="#supplies" class="nav-cta" …>` with
    the new `aria-label`; no `<button class="nav-cta">` remaining.
  - Heading hierarchy unchanged. No CLS change (no new layout, no new
    client JS). No new dependencies.

**Expected impact.**
- Google: eligible for `FAQPage` rich results (the FAQ "What people are
  asking" surface) in addition to the existing `Product` rich results.
- Deep links from search results to a product now land on that product's
  `<article>`, not the section header — improving the "View on page"
  jump experience.
- Cart control is now keyboard-focusable as a link, announces its real
  destination to assistive tech, and is no longer a no-op interactive
  button. Removes a latent UX dead-end.
- Maintenance: a future FAQ edit is now a one-place change in
  `src/data/faqs.ts`; both the page and the schema update together.

**Files modified.**
- `src/data/faqs.ts` *(new)*
- `src/app/layout.tsx`
- `src/app/page.tsx`

**Follow-ups uncovered (TODO for future runs).**

- [ ] **`apple-touch-icon` + `manifest.webmanifest`** — still open. Next.js
      16 supports `src/app/apple-icon.tsx` and `src/app/manifest.ts` as
      programmatic routes; both would inherit the `#000` brand colour and
      close the iOS/Android home-screen icon gap.
- [ ] **Outro footer dead links** (Terms, Privacy, Studio, Instagram all
      `href="#"`). Audit recommended leaving them as deliberate
      placeholders on a conceptual-brand site, but the question is still
      open. Decide per link in a future run.
- [ ] **No contact surface.** No address, no email, no contact route.
      Trust gap for a commerce-flavoured page. A single `mailto:` in the
      footer would close it.
- [ ] **Outro disclosure copy** still says "back button is in the
      upper-left of this window" — wrong on Windows and on mobile.
      Generalise.
- [ ] **`Instrument_Serif` not used by OG image** — currently falls back
      to `ui-serif`. Loading the actual Google Font as a buffer inside
      `opengraph-image.tsx` would tighten brand coherence.
- [ ] **Lighthouse baseline** — still unmeasured. A first pass would let
      future runs target the worst metric.

## 2026-05-12 — SEO foundation + social-share metadata + Product structured data

**Area:** Site-wide `<head>` metadata, crawl signals, share rendering.

**Why this was the highest-leverage target.**
The site is a single-page conceptual brand with a deliberately provocative name
("Blacks For Sale", with a self-aware disclaimer in the footer). Prior to this
run the `Metadata` export contained only `title` and `description`. That meant:

- Shares on Slack, iMessage, Twitter, Discord, Linear and any unfurler
  rendered the bare URL with no preview image and no context-bearing
  description — actively bad for a name whose first reading is hostile.
- Search engines had no Open Graph fallback, no Twitter card, no canonical, no
  `metadataBase`, no `robots` directive, no `sitemap.xml`, no `robots.txt`.
- Six on-page products with declared prices had no `Product` schema, so they
  were ineligible for Google product rich results.
- No `themeColor` / `colorScheme` meant browser chrome rendered light on a
  page that's pure black.

**Changes.**
- `src/app/layout.tsx` — expanded `Metadata` export: `metadataBase`,
  title template, `applicationName`, `authors`, `creator`, `publisher`,
  `category`, intent-targeted `keywords` (real query intents — "black
  notebook", "matte black notebook", "silver gel pen", "black cardstock",
  not generic filler), `alternates.canonical`, `formatDetection`, full
  `openGraph` block, full `twitter` card (`summary_large_image`), and
  `robots` directive with Google-specific image/snippet limits.
- `src/app/layout.tsx` — added `viewport` export (`themeColor: #000`,
  `colorScheme: dark`, `width: device-width`, `initialScale: 1`).
- `src/app/layout.tsx` — emitted two `application/ld+json` scripts:
  `Organization` and `ItemList` of all six `Product` entries with
  `Offer` (price, currency, availability).
- `src/app/opengraph-image.tsx` — programmatic 1200×630 OG image
  rendered with `next/og`. Pure black background, editorial-serif
  "Dark / Matter." wordmark, share-safe disclaimer-aware sub-copy, and
  the same coordinate/edition motif used in the page nav. Statically
  prerendered.
- `src/app/sitemap.ts` — single-URL sitemap (the site is one page).
- `src/app/robots.ts` — `Allow: /` for all UAs, with `Host` and
  `Sitemap` directives pointing at the resolved site URL.
- `src/lib/site.ts` — single source of truth for site name, tagline,
  description, share-description, and `siteUrl`. The URL resolver
  prefers `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL`, then `VERCEL_PROJECT_PRODUCTION_URL`,
  then `VERCEL_URL`, then `http://localhost:3000`, so OG/canonical
  URLs resolve correctly in preview and production without manual
  configuration.
- `src/data/products.ts` — extracted product data (id, chapter, title,
  subtitle, price string, `priceAmount`, currency, spec, copy, tags)
  out of `page.tsx` so both the page and the JSON-LD ItemList consume
  one list. Visuals are paired locally inside `page.tsx` via a
  `Record<ProductId, ComponentType>` map.
- `src/app/page.tsx` — now imports `products` from `@/data/products`
  and pairs the right SVG visual per `id`. Rendering is unchanged.

**Verification.**
- `bun run lint` — clean.
- `bunx tsc --noEmit` — clean.
- `bun run build` — clean. Five routes prerendered statically: `/`,
  `/_not-found`, `/opengraph-image`, `/robots.txt`, `/sitemap.xml`.
- Live HTML inspection on `bun run start`:
  - `<title>`, `<meta name="description">`, canonical link, theme-color,
    robots directive, color-scheme all present.
  - 11 `og:*` tags emitted including `og:image` pointing to
    `/opengraph-image` with `width=1200`, `height=630`, `type=image/png`,
    `og:image:alt`.
  - 8 `twitter:*` tags emitted with `summary_large_image`.
  - 2 `application/ld+json` scripts in DOM (Organization + ItemList).
  - `GET /opengraph-image` → 200, `image/png`, 51 KB.
  - `GET /robots.txt` → valid with `Host:` and `Sitemap:` directives.
  - `GET /sitemap.xml` → valid XML with the homepage URL.
- Title length: 52 chars (≤60). Description length: 154 chars (140–160).
  One `<h1>`. Heading hierarchy unchanged (h1 → h2 → h3 → h4).

**Expected impact.**
- Google: eligible for `Product` rich results across the six SKUs;
  improved crawl coverage via `sitemap.xml`; canonical resolves the
  `https://…/` vs `https://…` form.
- Social: every unfurled share now carries a brand-aligned image with
  the disclaimer-aware tagline, materially reducing the chance the
  bare URL is read out of context.
- Lighthouse SEO: existing missing-meta deductions resolved; no
  expected impact on LCP/CLS/INP (no client JS added, no layout shift,
  OG image is a separate static route).

**Files modified.**
- `src/app/layout.tsx`
- `src/app/page.tsx`
- `src/app/opengraph-image.tsx` *(new)*
- `src/app/sitemap.ts` *(new)*
- `src/app/robots.ts` *(new)*
- `src/data/products.ts` *(new)*
- `src/lib/site.ts` *(new)*

**Follow-ups uncovered (TODO for future runs).**

- [ ] **Outro footer dead links.** Terms, Privacy, Studio, Instagram
      all currently `href="#"`. They are visible to every visitor and
      hurt both UX and E-E-A-T signals. Decide per link: implement,
      remove, or annotate as placeholder.
- [ ] **No contact surface anywhere.** No address, no email, no
      contact route. For a commerce-flavoured site this is a trust
      gap. Even a single `mailto:` in the footer would close it.
- [ ] **`/cart` is a button with no destination.** The nav "Cart"
      control reads as commerce but does nothing. Either wire to a
      stubbed `/cart` route with a "currently quiet" empty state, or
      relabel.
- [ ] **No FAQ JSON-LD.** Six FAQ entries already exist on-page; add
      `FAQPage` schema for an extra rich-result surface.
- [ ] **Single-page hash links + JSON-LD `@id`.** Product anchors
      currently scroll to `#supplies` (the section). Add per-product
      anchors (`id={p.id}`) on each `<article>` so the `Product`
      `@id` in JSON-LD resolves to a real fragment and "View on page"
      deep links from search results work.
- [ ] **`apple-touch-icon` + `manifest.webmanifest`.** Favicon exists
      but iOS bookmarks and Android PWA installs will fall back to a
      light icon on a non-dark background.
- [ ] **`Instrument_Serif` not used by OG image.** Currently falls
      back to `ui-serif`. Loading the actual Google Font as a buffer
      inside `opengraph-image.tsx` would tighten brand coherence.
- [ ] **Lighthouse run.** None measured yet. A baseline pass would
      let future runs target the worst metric.
- [ ] **Copy: outro disclosure paragraph.** Strong, but mentions
      "back button is in the upper-left of this window" — wrong on
      Windows and on mobile. Generalise.
